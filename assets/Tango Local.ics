  SEPTEMBER 11th through 15thArgentine Tango Workshop with Special Guest 
 Instructors George & Jairelbhi Furlong\nDurango Tango is proud to welcom
 e George and Jairelbhi Furlong\, founders of Evolution Tango\, from Dall
 as\, TX!  I have often used their on-line videos for inspiration when te
 aching our classes.  Having the opportunity to meet them and spend time 
 with them at my (3) most recent festivals (they were there teaching at n
 ational events that attract the highest caliber instructors)\, was the p
 erfect introduction and segue to invite them here to Durango.  The Furlo
 ng's have a special way of teaching that seems to simplify the instructi
 on and offer the targeted tips that are key elements to the successful a
 ccomplishment of the intended movement.  I am thrilled that they have ac
 cepted our invitation\, and excited for them to bring their simple and c
 oncise teaching stye to Durango!! George and Jairelbhi will offer group 
 workshop lessons\, and will also be available to offer private lessons d
 uring their stay (by appointment\, contact Jason) .  Combining the indiv
 idual attention of private lessons\, and group lessons is a fantastic wa
 y to advance your tango!! Scroll down for the schedule\, more info\, and

 C-M/edit?pli=1\n\n\nPRIVATE LESSONS:\n\nPrivate lessons are an excellent
  way to advance your tango (combining group and private is probably the 
 best way). I highly recommend private lessons to all students. They meet
  you right where you are at\, and the one-on-one instruction is tailored
  to your specific needs and goals. Privates can be taken by individuals\
 , or couples. George and Jairelbhi will be available for private lesson 
 by appointment beginning Friday the 12th\, through Monday the 15th. Plea
 se feel free to contact me for more info\, and if you would like guidanc
 e on what to work on in your private.\n\n$120/hr single instructor\, $15
 0 for the instructor pair.\n\nFOR MORE INFO OR TO SCHEDULE A PRIVATE LES
 SON: \n\nJason Chapman \n\n(970) 749-5606\, or tangoindurango@gmail.com\
 n\n\n\nPlease make all payments to Jason (for classes and privates). See
  below for the Venmo link for payment.\n\n\n\n**SHOULD I TAKE THIS CLASS
 ?**\n\nAll classes can have value for all students of tango. This worksh
 op is not for those without tango any experience or foundation. Particip
 ants must have knowledge of basic movements (walk\, back and forward och
 os\, the cross). Remember\, tango is a personal journey. One rarely mast
 ers a technique in one lesson\, but more often unlocks the keys to begin
  to master the movement over time . How much a student advances their da
 nce (in any particular class) depends on the individual\, and how much e
 xperience/foundation they bring to that class.  Based on my opinion\, an
 d my knowledge of where our groups are\, I have chosen each lesson to tr
 y to meet the needs of the majority of students in our community. My rec
 ommendation is to take advantage of the George and Jairelbhi's time in D
 urango. The best value is to register for the Full Weekend Pass. This al
 lows you the freedom to take any class  that interests you (at a discoun
 ted rate over A' la cart)\, and opens the door to get the most out of th
 e opportunity that George and Jairelbhi bring to Durango. Combine group 
 lessons and private lessons to really advance your tango!!! Feel free to
  contact me if you feel you need a more specific recommendation\, or wan
 t further questions addressed before making your choice.\n\n\n\n• About 
 George and Jairelbhi\n\nBorn to an Argentinean family\, Tango was a pres
 ence in George’s life since his early childhood. Thanks to a highly musi
 cal family\, he started his musical training at age 10 and continued thr
 ough high school and college.\n\nA native of Caracas\, Venezuela\, Jaire
 lbhi began her dance training at age 9\, joining Las Voces Blancas\, one
  of the top dance schools for children in the country.  Because of her g
 raceful movements and perseverance\, she became part of the school’s dan
 ce troupe\, making television performances and traveling frequently.\n\n
 Recognized for their musicality\, George and Jairelbhi Furlong have perf
 ormed and taught in cities throughout the United States\,Canada\, Mexico
 \, Central America\, China\, and Russia\, as well as in Buenos Aires (Ar
 gentina)\, and are seen as one of the most promising Argentine tango cou
 ple of their generation.\n\nThey have performed with the Fort Worth Symp
 hony\, Dallas Symphony\, San Francisco Symphony\, Lisandro Adrover’s Qui
 nteto\,Opus Cuatro\, and with bandeonists Horacio Romo and Daniel Binell
 i. They toured the USA in 2007 as part of the cast of ‘Tango Buenos’\, a
 nd Mexico in 2008 with the Hugo Patyn Dance Company.\n\nFrom 2011-2016\,
  they were part of the cast of "This is Tango Now" created by Fernanda G
 hi and Guillermo Merlo. They traveled throughtout the USA and toured Chi
 na with Fernanda and Guillermo's "Identidad" and “Carmen de Buenos Aires
 .” They also have performed in shows such as "Maria de Buenos Aires" wit
 h San Antonio Opera.\n\nOften invited to be part of the most renowned Ta
 ngo festivals in the United States\, George and Jairelbhi created ‘Evolu
 tiontango’ in 2005\, a dance group based in Dallas\, Texas\, and have pr
 oduced\, directed\, and choreographed ‘Tango: Now and Then\,’ ‘Evolution
 Tango\,’ and 'Shades of Tango' among several other shows.\n\n\nREGISTER
